## AI+News: Nowcasting the Global Risks Interconnections from the Web
### We envision a future where journalists will no longer be limited to report past or current affairs, but they will be empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to write about future events with a fair degree of certainty.

Our goal is to predict and visualize the (non-obvious) interconnections of global risks that will be at the core of tomorrowâ€™s news.

Minerva leverages news data collections available in the Web and uses Artificial Intelligence based on Machine Learning (AI/ML) to discover the multiple relations among global risks, a data-driven approach that is more appealing in terms of timeliness and efficient discovery of such relations than current methodologies based on opinion surveys.
