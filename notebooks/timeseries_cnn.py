    """:Return: a Keras Model for predicting the next value in a timeseries given a fixed-size lookback window of previous values.

    The model can handle multiple input timeseries (`nb_input_series`) and multiple prediction targets (`nb_outputs`).

    :param int window_size: The number of previous timeseries values to use as input features.  Also called lag or lookback.
    :param int nb_input_series: The number of input timeseries; 1 for a single timeseries.
      The `X` input to ``fit()`` should be an array of shape ``(n_instances, window_size, nb_input_series)``; each instance is
      a 2D array of shape ``(window_size, nb_input_series)``.  For example, for `window_size` = 3 and `nb_input_series` = 1 (a
      single timeseries), one instance could be ``[[0], [1], [2]]``. See ``make_timeseries_instances()``.
    :param int nb_outputs: The output dimension, often equal to the number of inputs.
      For each input instance (array with shape ``(window_size, nb_input_series)``), the output is a vector of size `nb_outputs`,
      usually the value(s) predicted to come after the last value in that input instance, i.e., the next value
      in the sequence. The `y` input to ``fit()`` should be an array of shape ``(n_instances, nb_outputs)``.
    :param int filter_length: the size (along the `window_size` dimension) of the sliding window that gets convolved with
      each position along each instance. The difference between 1D and 2D convolution is that a 1D filter's "height" is fixed
      to the number of input timeseries (its "width" being `filter_length`), and it can only slide along the window
      dimension.  This is useful as generally the input timeseries have no spatial/ordinal relationship, so it's not
      meaningful to look for patterns that are invariant with respect to subsets of the timeseries.
    :param int nb_filter: The number of different filters to learn (roughly, input patterns to recognize).

        # the input timeseries, the activation of each filter at that position.
